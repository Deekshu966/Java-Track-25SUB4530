Collections
-----------

collections are objects used to store, manipulate and retrieve group of data as a
single unit dynamically.

Array
-----

1. Fixed Size
int[] a = new int[10]; --> we store only 10 values
int[] b = new int[150]; --> 


2. No much built in methods for processing -- Arrays' class 

3. No Type saftely ( Old Java) -- homogenous we cannot mix diff data types

4. Poor flexibility - Diff insert / delete an array value in between



Collection of Objects
---------------------
1. dynamic in size
2. plenty of builtin methods
3. Type Saftey - Heterogenous data types
4. high flexibility and performance



To organize diff types of group of objects, java has introduced collection framework

The collection framework is a set of interfaces, classes and algorithms that 
provide a standard way to store and process the data


G1
G2
G3
G4
G5


interfaces --> define the behavior
classes ---> Implement the behavior
Algorithms --> methods for processing the data (sorting, searching, shuffling)


Methods in Collection interface
--------------------------------

1. add() --> add an element to the collection

2. remove() --> remove an element from the collection

3. size() --> return the no of elements in the collection

4. contains() --> find an element in the collection



LIST (interfaces)
----
1. It will allow duplicate elements
2. Insertion order is maintained
3. elements are stored in linear fashion
4. elements are retrieved through its index
5. null values are allowed
6. elements can be inserted in between the group

ArrayList --> implemented by using Arrays

LinkedList ---> implemented by using LinkedList 

add(int index, element e) -- add the element at the given index
get(int index)  ---> retrieve the element from the given index
set(int index, element e) -- update the element at the given index
remove(int index) --> remove the element at the given index
indexOf(Object e)--> returns the index for the given object


import java.util.*;---->util package for collections



public boolean check(int n){
	if(n%4==0)
		return true;
	else
		return false;
}


n -> n%4 == 0;


Collections class
----------------
Utility methods for the collection framework

The collections class contains static methods to perform common operations such
as sorting, searching, reversing, synch and creating unmodifiable collections

Key characteristics

1. collections class contains only static methods
2. cannot be instantiated
3. works on existing any collection object

1. sort() -- used to sort the given the values in the ascending order (default)




Set
---
Set is a collection sub class

HashSet
--------
1. It will not allow duplicates
2. Insertion order is not maintained
3. null values are allowed only once
4. Elements are arranged in random manner
5. elements cannot be accessed by its index


LinkedHashSet --> all properties of hashset or set except the insertion order is maintained


1. not allow duplicates
2. insertion order is maintained
3. null values are allowed only once
4. elements are arranged in linear fashion
5. elements cannot be accessed by its index



TreeSet
------
1. not allow duplicaes
2. insertion order is not maintained
3. null values are allowed only once
4. elements are not arranged in linear fashion
5. elemets cannot be access by its index.
6. displays the elments in the sorted order





 Override the hashCode and Equals method

In Java two objects are considered to be equal only when both of them
have same reference hashcode and same contents
