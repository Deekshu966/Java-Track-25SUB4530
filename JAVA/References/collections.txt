Collections
-----------

collections are objects used to store, manipulate and retrieve group of data as a
single unit dynamically.

Array
-----

1. Fixed Size
int[] a = new int[10]; --> we store only 10 values
int[] b = new int[150]; --> 


2. No much built in methods for processing -- Arrays' class 

3. No Type saftely ( Old Java) -- homogenous we cannot mix diff data types

4. Poor flexibility - Diff insert / delete an array value in between



Collection of Objects
---------------------
1. dynamic in size
2. plenty of builtin methods
3. Type Saftey - Heterogenous data types
4. high flexibility and performance



To organize diff types of group of objects, java has introduced collection framework

The collection framework is a set of interfaces, classes and algorithms that 
provide a standard way to store and process the data

interfaces --> define the behavior
classes ---> Implement the behavior
Algorithms --> methods for processing the data (sorting, searching, shuffling)


Methods in Collection interface
--------------------------------

1. add() --> add an element to the collection

2. remove() --> remove an element from the collection

3. size() --> return the no of elements in the collection

4. contains() --> find an element in the collection



LIST (interfaces)
----
1. It will allow duplicate elements
2. Insertion order is maintained
3. elements are stored in linear fashion
4. elements are retrieved through its index
5. null values are allowed
6. elements can be inserted in between the group

ArrayList --> implemented by using Arrays

LinkedList ---> implemented by using LinkedList 

add(int index, element e) -- add the element at the given index
get(int index)  ---> retrieve the element from the given index
set(int index, element e) -- update the element at the given index
remove(int index) --> remove the element at the given index
indexOf(Object e)--> returns the index for the given object
