utility predefined functional interfaces

1. Predicate

2. Function

3. Consumer

4. Supplier

5. BiConsumer

6. BiFunction

7. BiPredicate

java.util.function;


Predicate- Is a functional interface, with only one method called test

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Predicate<T>{
	public boolean test(T t);
}

x -> x%2==0;

class Test{
	public Boolean isEven(int x){
		if(x%2==0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}
	public Boolean isPrime(int x){
		// logic to check the prime
		return true if prime else false;
	}
}

Test t = new Test();
t.isPrime(10);---> true
t.isPrime(5);----> false


Function - It is also a functional interface with one method called apply which will take
one argument of any type and returns one value of any type

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T,R> {
		public R apply(T t);
}


Supplier - It is also a functional interface with one method called get(), it will not take
any argument but returns a value

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<R>{
	public R get();
}

Consumer - It is also functional interface with one method called accept, it will take one
parameter but not returns any value;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T>{
	public void accept(T t);
}
 

BiPredicate- It is also a functional interface with only one method called test which will
take two inputs of any datatype but returns only Boolean value

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiPredicate<T1,T2>{
	public Boolean test(T1 t1, T2 t2);
}


Bifunction - It is also a functional interface with only one method called apply which will
take two inputs of any datatype and can return any datatype

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiFunction<T1,T2,R>{
	public R apply(T1 t1, T2 t2);
}



BiConsumer - It is also a functional interface with only one method called accept which will
take two parameters of any type and returns none.

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiConsumer<T1,T2>{
	public void accept(T1 t1, T2 t2);
}
