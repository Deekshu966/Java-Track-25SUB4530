Multi Threading - It is the process of simultenously executing the parts 
of the same program

application ---> processor 

single processor can execute only one job at a time

OS -- Job Scheduling

OS Level -- Simultenously executing the jobs


Programming

program begin
s1-->task1 begin
s2
s3---> Interrupt --. read a value from keyboard  Thread-1
s4
s5--->task1 end
s6---> task2 begin
s7
s8			Thread-2
s9
s10--> tasks2  end
s11---> task3 begin
s12
s13			Thread-3
s14
s15--> tasks3  end

program end

Thread --> it is a light weight process under execution

cases in which Thread will go from Running state to Idle state

1. Sleep(1000) method call

2. When there is an IO Interrrupt

3. When a thread is called by wait()

How to create a thread in java

Thread can be created in 2 ways:

1. Thread class - in java.lang package which contains all thread life cycle methods

2. Runnable Interface - A functional interface which has only method called run

public void run(){

}

Thread Scheduler-- is a process which is responsible for implementing
Multithreading


Any runtime errors are handled by using a predefined exception called

InterruptedException


Suggested or standard way to create a thread is by using runnable interface

1. In thread class approach, we mixing both thread logic and task logic together


ExecutorFramework works only with Runnable / Callable interfaces


Thread methods

1. run()
2. start()
3. sleep()

Thread priorities range from 1 to 10

1 being lowest
10 is highest

t1--> 1  ---> public 5
t2---> 5 ---> MLA/ MP 
t3---> 10---> Minister 
1 -- 5 -- 10
if you create any thread --> default priority of 5

getPriority()
setPriority(int priority)

join() -join makes the current thread to wait until the target thread finishes
the execution




yield() -- It will the other thread to wait until the current thread finishes

Synchronization()
------------------

It is the process of control access to shared resources so that only one
thread executes at a time


Java locks the resource and monitors

synchronized keyword is used to achieve the sychornization

1. Object level
2. method level
3. block level

class counter{
	int count=0;
	synchronized void increment(){
		count++;
	}
}


class counter{
	int static counter;
	
	synchronized {
		counter++;
	}
	public void showcouner(){
		Sop(couter);
	}
}

synchronize(obj);

preferred way of synchronization is at block level
