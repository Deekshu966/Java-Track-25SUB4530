Use Case 1: Home Loan and Personal Loan
----------------------------------------
For the clients, Bank XYZ needs to calculate a home loan and a personal loan.
As a result, the bank has created a Loan class with a loanCalc() method.

To calculate a home loan, the loan amount, number of years, and interest percentage are required as inputs.
To calculate a personal loan, only the loan amount and interest percentage are required as inputs.

Use the method overloading concept to calculate the total amount payable including interest.
Finally, print the monthly amount that needs to be paid by the client.

Use Case 2: Vehicle Loan and Business Loan
----------------------------------------------
For the clients, Bank XYZ needs to calculate a vehicle loan and a business loan.
Therefore, the bank has created a Loan class with a loanCalc() method.

To calculate a vehicle loan, the loan amount, loan tenure in years, and interest percentage are required as inputs.
To calculate a business loan, the loan amount and interest percentage are required as inputs.

Apply the method overloading technique to compute the total amount payable with interest.
Display the monthly installment amount that the client has to pay.



Problem Statement 3: Student Course Registration
-------------------------------------------------
Alex is developing a student course registration application and wants to record the unique course IDs selected by 
a student. Help Alex by implementing the necessary functionality using a HashSet to store unique course IDs. Additionally, take user input to register courses.

Instructions:
--------------
Implement a class named CourseRegistration with the following features:

A private HashSet<Integer> named courseIds to store unique course IDs.

A constructor that initializes the courseIds HashSet.

A method named addCourseId(int id) to add a course ID to the HashSet.

A method named getRegisteredCourses() that returns the HashSet containing unique course IDs.

In the Main class:
------------------
Create an instance of the CourseRegistration class named courseRegistration.

Use a Scanner to take user input for the number of courses to register.

In a loop, take user input for each course ID and register it using the addCourseId method.

Display the registered course IDs using the getRegisteredCourses method.



Problem Statement 2: Employee Attendance Tracker
--------------------------------------------------
Maria is developing an employee attendance tracking system and wants to store the unique employee IDs that marked attendance for the day. Help Maria by implementing the required functionality using a HashSet to store unique employee IDs. Additionally, take user input to record attendance.

Instructions:

Implement a class named AttendanceTracker with the following features:

A private HashSet<Integer> named employeeIds to store unique employee IDs.

A constructor that initializes the employeeIds HashSet.

A method named markAttendance(int id) to add an employee ID to the HashSet.

A method named getPresentEmployees() that returns the HashSet containing unique employee IDs.

In the Main class:

Create an instance of the AttendanceTracker class named attendanceTracker.

Use a Scanner to take user input for the number of employees marking attendance.

In a loop, take user input for each employee ID and record it using the markAttendance method.

Display the present employee IDs using the getPresentEmployees method.
