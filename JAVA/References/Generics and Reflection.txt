Type Saftey - Ensuring that only the correct data type is used at compile time, to 
prevent runtime errors

without typesaftey;

1. errors occur at runtime
2. program may fail unexpectedly
3. Bugs are very hard to detect


Generics: Generics is a way which will allows us to write type-safe, reusable and compiletime
checked code by specifiying type parameters.

Generics can be applied at 

1. class level
2. Method level
3. Variable Level - This is achieved through class or method levels only

class Box<T>{
	private T data;
	void set(T data){
		this.data = data;
	}
	T get(){
		return data;
	}
}

Box box = new Box();  // error
Box<Integer> b1 = new Box();
Box<Float> b2 = new Box();
Box<Double> b3 = new Box();


Box<String> b2 = new Box();

b1.set(10);
sop(b1.get());--> 10


b2.set("hello");
sop(b2.get());


Integer --> string, Boolean, Complex class is completely diff

Integer --> float, double  --> Number

upper bound wild cards ---> An upper bound wildcard restricts the generic type to the specific class
and its Sub classes only


Number ----> Integer,Float, double

Employee --> PermannentEmployee and TempEmployee
extends -- used to specifiy the wild card

class TestEmployee<TempEmployee >{




}



class Box<T extends Number>{
	private T data;
	void set(T data){
		this.data = data;
	}
	T get(){
		return data;
	}
}



Java Reflection
----------------

Java Reflection is an API that allows a program to:

Inspect, analyze, and manipulate classes, methods, fields and constructors at runtime
even if they are private


why do I need Reflection:

Java is statically typed class structure which is fixed at compile time:

Reflection allows:

1. framework development
2. dynamic object creation
3. Method invocation without knowing class in advance
4. Dependency Injection
