1. While creating the object, class needs a constructor




1. If a constructor is not defined in the class, then Java will provide a default constructor
internally. --> by using that default constructor object is created.


2.If we define any type of constructor, then java will take userdefined constructor
 to create the object


PolymorphismS
------------

The ability of an entity to exist in more than one form is called polymorphism

1. Compiletime Polymorphism --> Constructor Overloading ---> Method Overloading


Method Overloading - When two or more functions have same name and if differs in the 
number or datatype of parameters, then they are called overloaded

public void f1(){

}

public void  f1(int x){

}

public void f1(int x, int y){


}



public void f1(int x){

}

public void f1(int ch, int z){

}

public void f1(float y){

}




public int f1(int x){

}

public float f1(int y){

}

public char f1(int z){

}

return type is not at all considered for overloading


Operator Overloading 

+ ----> 3 + 4 

sop("Hello" + "Hai" );---> Hello Hai

public void f1(int x){

}

f1(10);----> 
f1(false); ---> error
f1("hello");---> error
f1(3.456); ---> truncate the decimal part --> f1 will receive 3 (not correct)



System.out.println(); ---> to print on the console / output

System.out.println("Hello"); ---> Hello
System.out.println(4);----> 4
System.out.println(false) ---> false
System.out.println(3.245f) --> 3.245





2. Runtime Polymorphism  - the form to be selected  will be known only at the time of
execution / runtime


--> Inheritance 

static keyword can be applied on a method also, when a method is static, then this method
can be called directly on the class without creating the object


static methods 			non static method





static variables		non static variables


1. a non static method can access both static variables and non static variables (instance )

2. a static method can access only static variables


Static is at class level (Parent)

Non static is at object level (Child)

Any static can be called without creating the object

ie a static variable or a static method can be called without creating an object


but a non static variable or non static method can be called only on the object, it
cannot be called on the class



Office -----> PermanentEmployee, TemporaryEmployee, HourlyBased


class PermanentEmployee{
	int empid;
	String name;
	String dept;
	double basic;
	double deductions
	public void calSalary(){
		//calculate the salry
		sal = (basic+0.55 + basic*0.25) -deductions
	}
	public void display(){
		// display the details
	}
}

class TemporaryEmployee{
	int empid;
	String name;
	String dept;
	double conSal;
	public void calSalary(){
		//calculate the salary of 25k
	}
	public void display(){
		// display the details
		
	}
}


class HourlyBasedEmployee{
	int empid;
	String name;
	String dept;
	int noh;
	double rph;
	public void calSalary(){
		sal = noh * rph;
	}
	public void display(){
		// display the details
	}
}


// code repition 

// code reusability ---> inheritance

Inheritance -- It is the process of acquiring the properties from one class to another class
The class which is giving properties is called as a base class / parent class
The class which is acquiring / taking properties is called as a derived class / child class
Inheritance is used for code reusability


class Employee{
	int empid;
	String name;
	String dept;
	public void display(){
		// display the details
	}
}


class PermanentEmployee extends Employee{
	int basic;
	int deductions
	public void calSalary(){
	// cal sal code 
	}


}

PermanentEmployee pe = new PermanentEmployee();
pe.empid
pe.name
pe.dept
pe.basic
pe.deductions
pe.calSalary()
pe.dipslay()

class TemporaryEmployee extends Employee{

	double conSal;
	public void calSalary(){
		//calculate the salary of 25k
	}
}

TemporaryEmployee te = new TemporaryEmployee();
te.empid
te.name
te.dept
te.conSal
te.calSalary()
te.display()


class HourlyBasedEmployee extends Employee{
	int noh;
	double rph;
	public void calSalary(){
		sal = noh * rph;
	}
}

HourlyBasedEmployee he = new HourlyBasedEmployee();
he.empid
he.name;
he.dept
he.noh
he.rph
he.calSalary()
he.display()


Diff types of inheritances

1. single inheritance
2. multilevel inheritance
3. multiple inheritance
4. hybrid inheritance
5. hirerachal inheritance

Java supports ----> Single Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance(Interface)

Overriding

1. Data Overriding
2. Method Overriding



Data Overriding - The process of suppressing the base variable value in the derived class
when both are having the same names


super --> super is a keyword used to represent its immediate parent

Method Overriding -- the process of suppressing the base class method in the derived
class when both are having the same signature;
